# About

The data is used to allow access from those ips to your origin on port 80 or 443 using a boolean var to apply the rule. Initially all tcp ports have been allowed to make uptimerobot check service status for custom port. Security group id is required to function terraform for adding rules. Switch off the variable values to make terraform take proper action. Use following commands to apply terraform configuration.

# Usage

* Create empty security group in AWS and gather the security group ID.
* Change variable values in tfvars file to true/false accordingly.

Next, apply following commands to make changes

```shell
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
